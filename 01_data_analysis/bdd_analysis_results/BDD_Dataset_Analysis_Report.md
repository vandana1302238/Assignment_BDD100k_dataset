## Data Quality & Attributes
- Invalid/Out-of-bounds/Empty boxes detected: **0** (see `data_quality_issues.csv`).
- Occluded/Truncated/Crowd distributions saved to `object_attributes.json`.

## Scenario Coverage & Hard Negatives
- Scenario coverage table: `scenario_coverage_counts.csv` (low-count cells in `scenario_coverage_lowcells.csv`).
- Images with zero detection classes logged to `negative_frames.csv`.

## Recommendations

1. **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Consider data
        augmentation or weighted sampling for underrepresented classes
2. **Quality Control**: Review outlier samples and flagged
quality issues for potential label errors
3. **Environmental Bias**: Ensure model training accounts
for weather/time-of-day/scene distributions
4. **Scale Handling**: Implement multi-scale training
and small-object strategies given S/M/L mix
6. **Crowding**: Prefer Soft-NMS / cluster-NMS when same-class IoU is high
